### Reflection 
print str "What have I gotten my self into?"

#This assignment took me 2-3hours. There was a lot of looking back in  the book trying to figure out why 
#my code wasn't working and I finally had to start asking for help to solve my print str crisis.
#And that triangular had to be removed but it wasnt in the eleipis so that took me a little bit of frustration
#to figure out. Coming with no programming experience at all, makes this a search for the answer sort of game....
