Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
1.fastq=GC=0.43029262963
2.fastq=GC=0.451051333333
3.fastq=GC=0.646864112524
4.fastq=GC=0.34852341166
5.fastq=GC=0.263157894737
6.fastq=GC=0.491518518519

Problem 3:

NameError: name 'linenum' is not defined
When linenum was not assigned to a variable the program 
couldn't define the next time linenum was used.
So linenum could not add 1 to itself.

If you remove gc_count = 0, the program repeats the same 
problem that linenum had.

Problem 4:

GC-content; 0.43029262963
AT-content; 0.568993851852

Collaboration:

Paul Phamp; walked me through the entire lab 
pretty much with those instructions on hw3.

Reflection:
I learned a valueable lesson. Before getting extremely stressed
out over not getting the results the first one hundred times,
that I should read the directions better.
