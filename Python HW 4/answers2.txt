Homework 4

Problem 5:

G;count: 5738773
C;count: 5879128
A;count: 7701287
T;count: 7661547

Problem 6:
The sum_count was different from the total_count ^ seq_count. 
There was a random nucleotide that was not C_G_A_T  but was N.
The seq_count can be used  as the base for solving GC_content.
The total can also.
They register the same values but use different methods.
This could be a more reliable source.

Problem 7:
AT/GC ratio: 1.322341747


Collaboration:
 Finally did one all on my own. Whoop.


Reflection: 

Took me awhile to debug this thing. I got lost on a loose : when adding in the other 
sum and etc. Wasn't fun. Almost blew up my computer over it. 
Lesson learned: Debugging comes best with a relaxing state of mind
and good music.
